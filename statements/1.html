Everyone knows that there is no God. But Someone(seems that's the real God?) believe in the opposite theorem! You are the greatest atheist(and maybe programmer) in the world, so you decide to prove your mind.<br>
Or simpler: Your task is to write a program in C++(the dead language) that gets one integer N (1<N<1000) and outputs the same number N to the standard output. Good luck and have fun!<br><br>
<b>Example Input 1:</b><br>
123<br><br>
<b>Example Output 1:</b><br>
123<br><br><br>
