Hello there! We have got a new problem for solving! it's also a problem with checker. Your task is to output a permutation of the numbers 1 to <b>N</b> (1<<b>N</b><1000) in which the number on index(indexation of an array begins in 0!!!) <b>a</b> is <b>b</b> (0<<b>a</b>, <b>b</b><<b>N</b>). Of course the task of the checker is harder but that isn't on your mind!<br><br>
<b>Input</b><br>
On the first line of the standard input will be the numbers <b>N</b>, <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>.
<br><br>
<b>Output</b><br>
On the first line of the standard output you have to print <b>any</b> correct permutation.<br><br>
<b>Example Input 1:</b><br>
5 3 2<br><br>
<b>Possible Output for Example 1:</b><br>
5 3 1 2 4<br><br>
